A nifty little repository wherein I play with implementing ML algorithms from scratch.

### Hidden Markov Model
**File:** HMM.ipynb

This file contains forward, backward, and Viterbi algorithms applied to a sample "occasionally dishonest casino" problem with Python. Working condition as of 29 April 2022 is not generalizable, but I endeavor to fix this in a future addition.

**File:** hmm_pomegranate.py

This file contains the forward/backward algorithm for decoding steps in HMM as well as training via Viterbi using pomegranate V0.14.6. Eventually I aim to remove this file in favor of my own original work in file HMM.ipynb
